  Real time fruit/vegetable detection for self check out in big name retail stores
  The self-checkout machines are not able to scan fruits and vegetables or other items that do not have a barcode.
  This is only a proof of concept. This technology is useful because in order to scan items without barcodes they have to
  manually entered either by the customer or the cashier.
