In traditional retail stores self checkouts are slow and tedious, produce don't have barcodes, barcodes are missing or broken and it takes forever for the one cashier to come over and help you out.

  Real time fruit/vegetable detection for self check out in big name retail stores
  The self-checkout machines are not able to scan fruits and vegetables or other items that do not have a barcode.
  This is only a proof of concept. This technology is useful because in order to scan items without barcodes they have to
  manually entered either by the customer or the cashier.
